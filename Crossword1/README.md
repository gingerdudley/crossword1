So most of my program works but the game wont restart itself, so to play multiple games
you will have to restart the server yourself. Also if the board generation isn't working
i know that it works for the input that was provided online (the trojans, travelever one)
so just use that to test the gameplay please if the generation is acting weird but it should work
thanks!
